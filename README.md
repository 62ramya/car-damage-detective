# Car Damage Detective
## Assessing Car Damage with Convolutional Neural Networks

Created a proof of concept to expedite the personal auto claims process with computer vision and deep learning. Identified damage location and severity to accuracies of 79% and 71% respectively, comparable to human performance. Trained a pipeline of convolutional neural networks using transfer learning with Keras and Theano to classify damage. Deployed consumer-facing web app with Flask and Bootstrap for real-time car damage evaluations. Data scraped from Google Images using Selenium, hand-labeled for classification and supplemented with the Stanford Car Image Dataset.
